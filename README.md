Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project contains an exploratory data analysis of a dataset. The goal of this analysis is to understand the underlying structure, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare the data for further statistical modeling or machine learning tasks.

What is EDA?
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in the data science pipeline. It involves using data visualization techniques and summary statistics to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

Key activities in this analysis include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Univariate Analysis: Examining individual variables using histograms, box plots, and descriptive statistics.

Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing interactions among multiple variables.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers and unusual data points.

By performing these steps, we can generate hypotheses, validate assumptions, and make informed decisions about feature engineering and model selection.
